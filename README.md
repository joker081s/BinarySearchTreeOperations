# BinarySearchTreeOperations
Operations on the binary search tree. The operations are insertion of node, searching of the data in the tree, deleting of the node and lastly, pre-order traversing of tree.

Binary Search Tree is a tree in which left node will have less than data from its parent node but on the right side data will be greater.

Example :

         Parent Node have data : 60
         Two Child Nodes have data : 30 and 70
         Then which have 30 data that will be the left node to the parent node
         But 70's node will be in the right of parent node.


                        60
                       /  \
                      /    \
                     30    70
